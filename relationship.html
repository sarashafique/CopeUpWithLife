        <p>At the heart of life lie the relationships we have with other people.
            <br>
            With family, co-workers and friends close by and far away at the other side of the world.
            <br>
            And how you let these relationships flow and grow has huge impact on the happiness both in your life and in
            the lives of the people you care about.

        <div class="box">
            <p> Relationships with friends and family always go through testing times and there will always be ups and
                downs. Some times they will let you down and sometimes you’ll let them down. But by practicing the
                points
                below you can help strengthen those bonds so that the glitches along the way can be smoothed over more
                quickly.

                It might be best not to try to do all of these at once. Perhaps just start by picking one or two ideas
                and
                work on them with one person and see what happens.</p>

                    <h2> Keep in touch</h2>
                    Call/txt/email/write/meet more often. These days technology makes it so easy to keep in touch and
                    yet we
                    still find ourselves drifting apart. Technology can help you keep in touch but it can never replace
                    being
                    together in person.

                    When I travelled overseas I emailed home regularly to friends and I was surprised at how well this
                    managed
                    to maintain those friendships, even over an extended period of time. This is important with the
                    people you
                    live with as well. Sometimes you can live in the same house yet not end up spending much time
                    together. But
                    whilst technology helps in many ways it can also hinder. A txt is no substitute for a face to face
                    conversation.

                    <h2>
                        Create quality time</h2>
                    If you haven’t had quality time with someone for a while then arrange to do so. There are some
                    friendships
                    where you might only catch up once a month, others a few times a week. Every relationship’s
                    different so
                    figure out who you’re neglecting and decide how you can correct this. It can help to pick a friend
                    and think
                    when the last time you had a decent conversation with them was.

                    <h2>
                        Remember birthdays & other dates</h2>
                    This is important with friends and essential with family. Some people say they aren’t fussed whether
                    about
                    people remembering their birthday but actually everyone appreciates it. How you remember people’s
                    birthdays
                    varies. Depending on how close you are it might just be a text or a phone call, or a present. I’m
                    not too
                    hot at remembering dates so I add them to Google Calendar. With the really important ones I add a
                    reminder
                    in a week ahead of the birthday so I’ve got time to organise a gift. These days with Facebook etc
                    it’s
                    easier than ever to keep track of birthdays.

                    <h2>
                        Listen more</h2>
                    The absolute number one way to improve a relationship is to listen more. And really listen. If you
                    think
                    people aren’t listening to you then chances are you aren’t listening to them either. Set the wheel
                    in motion
                    and listen to them first. Really try to see things from their perspective. If you want people to
                    listen to
                    you then listen to them first.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h2> Look for ways to help them or make their lives better</h2>
                    Do a chore they normally do, give them a lift somewhere, help them carry something.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Try not to take them for granted</h2>
                    It’s easy to get a bit too comfortable in some relationships. We get caught up in other areas of our
                    life
                    and forget about some friendships then wonder why they aren’t there for us anymore. Friendships need
                    to be
                    maintained or they will fade away.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2> Open up</h2>
                    Tell them how great they are and how much you love having them as a friend/partner etc. Be specific,
                    tell
                    them what it is that you love about them and why that is such a great thing.

                One of the most profound experiences we can have in our lives is the connection we have with other human
                beings. Positive and supportive relationships will help us to feel healthier, happier, and more
                satisfied
                with our lives. So here are a few tips to help you to develop more positive and healthy relationships in
                all
                areas of your life:</p>
            <ol class="list">
                <li>
                    <h2>Accept and celebrate differences.</h2> One of the biggest challenges we experience in
                    relationships is that we
                    are all different. We can perceive the world in many ways. Certainly astumbling block that we come
                    across
                    when we try to build relationships is a desire or an expectation that people will think like we do
                    and, in
                    this way, it is so much easier to create a rapport. We feel more comfortable when we feel that
                    people “get”
                    us and can see our point of view. Life, however, would be very dull if we were all the same and,
                    while we
                    may find it initially easier, the novelty of sameness soon would wear off. So accepting and
                    celebrating that
                    we are all different is a great starting point.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2> Listen effectively.</h2> Listening is a crucial skill in boosting another person’s self-esteem,
                    the silent
                    form of flattery that makes people feel supported and valued. Listening and understanding what
                    others
                    communicate to us is the most important part of successful interaction and vice versa.

                    Active or reflective listening is the single most useful and important listening skill. In active
                    listening,
                    we also are genuinely interested in understanding what the other person is thinking, feeling,
                    wanting, or
                    what the message means, and we are active in checking out our understanding before we respond with
                    our own
                    new message. We restate or paraphrase our understanding of their message and reflect it back to the
                    sender
                    for verification. This verification or feedback process is what distinguishes active listening and
                    makes it
                    effective.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Give people your time.</h2> Giving time to people is also a huge gift. In a world where time is
                    of the essence
                    and we are trying to fit in more than one lifetime, we don’t always have the time to give to our
                    loved ones,
                    friends, and work colleagues. Technology has somewhat eroded our ability to build real rapport and
                    we
                    attempt to multi-task by texting and talking at the same time.

                    Being present in the time you give to people is also important, so that, when you are with someone,
                    you are
                    truly with someone and not dwelling in the past or worrying about the future. The connection we make
                    with
                    other people is the verytouchstone of our existence, and devoting time, energy, and effort to
                    developing and
                    building relationships is one of the most valuable life skills.

                <li>
                    <h2>Develop your communication skills.</h2> Communication occurs when someone understands you, not
                    just when you
                    speak. One of the biggest dangers with communication is that we can work on the assumption that the
                    other
                    person has understood the message we are trying to get across.

                    Poor communication in the workplace can lead to a culture of back stabbing and blame, which, in
                    turn, can
                    affect our stress levels, especially when we don’t understand something or feel we have been misled.
                    It also
                    can have a positive effect on morale when it works well and motivates individuals to want to come
                    into work
                    and do a great job.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2> Manage mobile technology.</h2> By now, pretty much everyone has a mobile phone and many people
                    have two or
                    more. While they are a lifesaver in an emergency, and an effective tool for communication, they also
                    can be
                    a complete distraction when people exhibit a lack of mobile phone etiquette.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Learn to give and take feedback.</h2> Feedback, in my opinion, is the food of progress, and
                    while it may not
                    always taste great, it can be very good for you. The ability to provide constructive feedback to
                    others
                    helps them to tap into their personal potential and can help to forge positive and mutually
                    beneficial
                    relationships. From your own personal perspective, any feedback you receive is free information and
                    you can
                    choose whether you want to take it on board or not. It can help you to tap into your blind spot and
                    get a
                    different perspective.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Learn to trust more.</h2> A long time ago, my brother and I had a philosophical debate about
                    what was more
                    important in a relationship—love, trust, or passion. I was a lot younger and more naive then and
                    caught up
                    in the heady rollercoaster of sensation seeking. I have grown to understand, however, that trust is
                    hugely
                    important in any relationship. Years later, I bought my brother a photograph of a little girl who
                    was
                    smiling and staring confidently at the camera with an elephant’s foot just above her head. The
                    caption was:
                    “To trust is more important than love.” I believe that sentiment is true because no love will last
                    without
                    equal amounts of respect and trust.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2> Develop empathy.</h2> There is a great expression that I learned a long time ago: “People will
                    forget what you
                    said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.”

                    Empathy and understanding builds connection between people. It is a state of perceiving and relating
                    to
                    another person’s feelings and needs without blaming, giving advice, or trying to fix the situation.
                    Empathy
                    also means “reading” another person’s inner state and interpreting it in a way that will help the
                    other
                    person and offer support and develop mutual trust.
                </li>
                <p> Every relationship we have can teach us something, and by building positive relationships with
                    others, we
                    will be happier and more fulfilled and feel more supported, supportive, and connected.
