                Stress is a normal part of life. We all encounter stress in a variety of different situations, forms and
                amounts. What causes stress for one person may seem like no big deal to someone else.
                <br> Stress can come from seemingly small events like heavy traffic or a long line at the store, or it
                can be a
                result of a crisis event, like the loss of a job, a death in the family, a pandemic such as that caused
                by
                the novel coronavirus, the virus that causes the infectious disease COVID-19, or the catastrophic
                flooding
                experienced in mid-Michigan.
                <br>The most important thing to do is to recognize, accept and manage your stress to avoid negative
                physical and
                emotional consequences. Stress that is not managed can manifest into chronic stress. Chronic stress has
                been
                shown to suppress your immune system, increase blood pressure and blood sugar levels and exacerbate
                underlying conditions like anxiety and depression.
                <br> Figuring out what stress management tools work best for you can be a process. While there is no
                perfect way
                to manage stress, here are some tips that may work for you and your family:
            <ul class="list">
                <li><h3> Know your own stress cues.</h3> For example, when you’re stressed, do you become forgetful, short
                    tempered, clumsy or something else? Think about what gets your attention the most. Observe your kids
                    and other family members for signs of stress and ask them to do the same for you. Sometimes other
                    people notice our stress cues before we do.</li>
                <li><h3>Take time to do something that is meaningful, relaxing and fun to you and your family.</h3> Read a book,
                    sit on the porch and enjoy the scenery, enjoy coffee with a friend, or have a family movie or game
                    night.</li>
                <li><h3>Practice deep breathing or mindfulness.</h3> When you start to become anxious and extremely stressed, try
                    sitting and breathing for a minute or so. It helps if you actually say in your mind, “I am breathing
                    in, and I am breathing out.” It may sound silly, but it keeps your mind focused on something you can
                    control: your breath. It helps to quiet your mind and help you relax. Teach kids how to use their
                    breath to calm down. Incorporate family breathing breaks throughout your daily routines. The more
                    you practice this when you are not stressed, the easier it is to tap into when you need it the most.
                </li>
                <li><h3>Get enough sleep.</h3> Most health experts recognize that individuals who get at least 8 hours of sleep
                    are less stressed, less sad and can manage anger Try an afternoon nap to supplement your sleep
                    needs, if possible. Some people find that even a 15-minute “cat nap” can feel very refreshing. Just
                    try not to sleep the afternoon away so you can still fall asleep at night. Make sure you are keeping
                    a healthy sleep schedule for your kids too.</li>
                <li><h3>Accept your emotions and feelings.</h3> It is OK to feel sad, anxious, angry or stressed. Noticing these
                    emotions and naming them can help us be compassionate towards ourselves. Console yourself like you
                    would your best friend: “Wow, I am sorry to hear you are feeling stressed/anxious. I am here for
                    you. Need a hug?” You can help your children accept their stressed or anxious emotions if you
                    recognize and name them and follow up with a hug.</li>
                <li><h3>Consider the emotional needs of your family members.</h3> Our priorities may shift suddenly in a crisis.
                    Make sure you understand and honor the needs of family members or other household residents during
                    the recovery process. According to North Dakota State University Extension, it is important for
                    adults to model appropriate emotional responses for children, as maintaining balance and calm will
                    help them to navigate through their own emotions.</li>
                    <li><h3>Conserve your energy for things you can control. </h3>There are countless things that happen of which we
                    have no control. Instead of spending energy on what if scenarios, devote your energy to tasks and
                    actions that you can complete to begin the process of restoration, healing or returning to normal.
                </li>
                    <li><h3>Develop or use your support system.</h3> Your support system consists of the people who may or can fill
                    different roles in your life. Use your support system to talk about your feelings and help you. If
                    you are limited from in-person socializing, reach out to people on social media, text messaging,
                    email or video calls to help you feel more connected to your support network. You may be helping
                    them feel more connected as well.</li>
                <li><h3>Laughter is the best medicine.</h3> Humor and laughter are great stress relievers and promote well-being.
                    Find some family-friendly comedies. Have a family joke-telling contest.
                </li>
                    <li><h3>Focus on your health and the health of others in your family.</h3> Often during stressful times,
                    individuals will turn to alcohol and drugs as a coping mechanism. These behaviors can lead to more
                    stress and anxiety afterwards. Instead, concentrate on healthy habits, such as eating more fruits
                    and vegetables and drinking more water. Try to fit in at least 30 minutes of physical activity a
                    day. You can do this by taking a walk around the house or neighborhood or putting on some music and
                    dancing. You could even have a family dance contest where each person teaches the others a new dance
                    move.</li>
                    <li><h3>Get professional help.</h3> If you are feeling overwhelmed, seek assistance from an outside source such
                    as your primary care provider or a mental health professional. Mental Health America is a great
                    resource for information on self-help tools and mental health screenings.</li>

        <h1 class="h-primary center">Career Pressure</h1>
        <div class="box">
            <p>Career is the most important part of one’s life. To put bread on your dining table, to gain respect
                from the society and for your self-satisfaction, a good career is a must. But the definition of
                “good career” is vague and depends on people to people.

                There is no such thing called as a good career. A career path that is good for me might not be
                necessarily good for others. Therefore, in this particular essay on career, we would like to dig
                deep and understand what a career is and how to choose one in order to lead a happy and content
                life.
            </p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li><h3>Children must not be force by their parents when choosing a specific career.</h3> They should be free to
                    decide the profession they want. I strongly agree that children should not be pressure and free to
                    decide path they desire, therefore they need to be considerate towards their parents.</li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Some parents, particularly professionals usually demand their children to follow their steps.</h3> These
                    kind of attitude put a lot of stress to their children's mind and their relationship. For instance,
                    when a parents are both doctors or lawyers, they simply assume that their son or daughter will
                    pursue the same career. As a result, children do not want to disappoint their parents are pressured
                    and forced to follow their path, even though they are not completely motivated or perhaps have
                    another job they want. These will also lead children to blame their parents when the times they
                    cannot success with the job that their parents chosen for them.</li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Young people must be free when it comes to selecting career.</h3> Parents may be the one who will support
                    them financially, however the decision should be lean on their children's own choice. Despite the
                    freedom that may be given to them, young people should open-up and communicate well to their
                    parents. They must explain to their mother and father and let them understand the reason behind
                    their decision to pursue different profession instead. Perhaps, their parents will support them in
                    the path they decided to chase.</li>

            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>
                In conclusion, parents should support and guide their children when choosing career rather than
                pressuring them. Hence, young people must be considerate enough to let their parents to understand
                and accept the path they decide for themselves.

        <h1 class="h-primary center">Social Stress</h1>
        <div class="box">
            <p>
                Social stress and anxiety disorder is considered the fourth most common psychiatric disorder.
                Devastating effects of social anxiety extend way beyond an individual feeling of distress in social
                situations, as those who undergo will demonstrate.
                <br>
                Social anxiety disorder is now and then referred to as social phobia which in general affects academic
                success, social situations and personal relationships among the students. “According to a study among
                college students it was found that around 40 per cent are under the vicious habit of alcohol
                consumption” (Kennard, 2007).
                <br>
                In yet another study, the association between anxiety, social stress, substance use, and gambling
                behaviour was examined. With a sample size 1,044 high school students from grades 7-11, this study has
                brought out important observations.
                <br>
                The researchers examined the adolescents state, trait, and generalized anxiety, social stress, substance
                use, and gambling behaviour. Results of this study disclosed facts such as “probable pathological
                gamblers report more daily and weekly alcohol consumption, use more uppers, downers, and hallucinatory
                drugs, and smoke more cigarettes every day when compared with non-gamblers, social gamblers, and
                gamblers at-risk for serious problems.
                <br>
                The study also revealed that probable pathological gamblers likewise reported greater levels of state
                anxiety, trait anxiety, and social stress compared with non-gamblers, social gamblers, and at-risk
                gamblers. Further they established through the study that adolescents with the highest state and trait
                anxiety scores had more severe gambling and substance abuse problems” (Ste-Marie et al. 2006).
                <br>
                There are also some contradiction results from some studies. For instance, recently published research
                by Ham et al (2007) was aimed at revealing the relationship between social anxiety and drinking,
                particularly within a college student population.
            </p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>
                    They found that social anxiety was truly unconnected to alcohol-related problems. Furthermore,
                    social
                    anxiety was largely unconnected to student’s motives for drinking alcohol.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Only individuals with high or moderate social anxiety appeared more likely to use alcohol as a
                    motive
                    for coping. Where as according to a recent report by the National Institute of Health (NIH), it was
                    found that anxiety is a psychological risk factor connected with heavy or problem drinking among
                    college
                    students (Repich, N.D.).</li>
                <li>
                    Racial-ethnic differences that increase social anxiety are another cause for social stress among
                    college
                    students. According to a study it was found that social anxiety was lower for White American when
                    compared to Hispanic American and Asian American students.</li>
                <li>
                    It was reasoned that racial-ethnic differences in social anxiety might be ethnically linked and
                    precipitated by diverse concerns for racial-ethnic minority groups (Lesure-Lester and King, 2005).
                    For
                    example, Joseph, a 1st generation Korean American student faces serious psychological stress and
                    depression.</li>
                <li>
                    Though he was a student with excellent track record in his previous educational programs, he is
                    presently facing a serious challenge in both health as well as his grades. This is more of a
                    psychological problem which could be helped out by using good counselling program. Similar problems
                    are
                    faced by many other students who migrate from different places for higher studies.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A good counselling at his high school counselling centre could be of great help not only to him but
                    also
                    for such similar cases. Students with emotional disturbance frequently require services from
                    counselling
                    that apply different eligibility criteria. The teenagers of the age of Joseph are quite diverse in
                    terms
                    of their needs and strengths.</li>
                <li>
                    The students present with a complex range of disabilities, from conduct disorder to schizophrenia.
                    Teenagers who feel as if their ethnicity, culture, values, learning styles, and interests are not in
                    synchrony with the evident services and mission of the college they attend are placed at risk for
                    underachievement and for leaving -either seeking transfer elsewhere or forsaking higher educational
                    study altogether.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Fear and Anxiety are clearly covering, aversive, actuated states focused on risk. They both include
                serious negative sentiments and solid substantial indications. Emotionally, notwithstanding, they take

                to safeguard oneself, fundamentally by escaping...</p>
            <p>Everyone has feelings of anxiety, nervousness, tension, and stress from time to time. Here are 5 ways to
                help manage them:</p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li><h3>Become a relaxation expert.</h3> We all think we know how to relax. But chilling out in front of the TV
                    or
                    computer isn't true relaxation. (Depending on what you're watching or doing, it could even make you
                    more
                    tense.) The same is true for alcohol, drugs, or tobacco. They may seem to relieve anxiety or stress,
                    but
                    it's a false state of relaxation that's only temporary. What the body really needs is daily practice
                    of
                    a relaxation technique — like deep breathing, tai chi, or yoga — that has a physical effect on the
                    mind.
                    For example, deep breathing helps to relax a major nerve that runs from the diaphragm to the brain,
                    sending a message to the entire body to let go and loosen up.
                </li>
                <li><h3>Get enough sleep, nourishment, and exercise.</h3> Want your mind and body to feel peaceful and strong
                    enough
                    to handle life's ups and downs? Get the right amount of sleep for your needs — not too much or too
                    little. Eat well: Choose fruit, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains for long-term energy
                    (instead of the short bursts that come from too much sugar or caffeine). And exercise to send oxygen
                    to
                    every cell in the body so your brain and body can operate at their best.
                </li>
                <li><h3>Connect with others.</h3> Spend time with friends or family. Organized activities are great, but just
                    hanging
                    out works too. Doing things with those we feel close to deepens our bonds, allowing us to feel
                    supported
                    and secure. And the fun and sharing that go with it allow us to feel happier and less upset about
                    things. If you feel worried or nervous about something, talking about it with someone who listens
                    and
                    cares can help you feel more understood and better able to cope. You'll be reminded that everyone
                    has
                    these feelings sometimes. You're not alone.
                </li>
                <li><h3>Connect with nature.</h3> Heading out for a walk in the park or a hike in the woods can help anyone
                    feel
                    peaceful and grounded. (Choose somewhere you feel safe so you can relax and enjoy your
                    surroundings.)
                    Walking, hiking, trail biking, or snowshoeing offer the additional benefit of exercise. Invite a
                    friend
                    or two — or a family member — along and enjoy feeling connected to people as well.
                </li>
                <li><h3>Pay attention to the good things.</h3> A great way to keep our minds off the worry track is to focus
                    our
                    thoughts on things that are good, beautiful, and positive. Appreciate the small, everyday blessings.
                    Allow yourself to dream, wish, and imagine the best that could happen.
                    Note: When anxiety or worry feels extreme, it may be a sign of an anxiety disorder. For someone who
                    has
                    an anxiety disorder, getting proper care from a health professional is important. These tips can
                    help
                    too, of course. But professional treatment is the only way to shake an anxiety disorder.

            <ul><li>Marriage pressure is something nearly every millennial experiences at some point in life. Despite
                external and even internal pressures, it's possible to #changedestiny.<br>If you are married, you know
                the pressure of marriage begins sometime in your mid twenties and peaks in your 30s. You all must have
                undergone this pressure from your family, relatives, friends and sometimes even random associations who
                don't leave an opportunity to tell you how 'this is the best time to marry' or how 'you should not wait
                any longer'. And sometimes the pressure gets so difficult to handle, it can lead to anxiety and even
                depression. But why do we have a timeline to marry at all?</li>
              <li>  In a society like ours, you are constantly going to be told by your friends and family how to love
                someone, how to handle relationships and when to get married. So when you feel peer pressure to get
                married, it's because that's more like a societal norm now. This can make it seem even more serious and
                scary at times. 29-year-old Farah shares, "My career is my top priority right now and it irks me to no
                ends when I am told I should get married. I keep telling everyone that my career is my priority and I
                don't have time to date but the fact is that no boy seems to like me well enough to marry me. And those
                  who like me do not match my criteria. It isn't simple at all!"</li>
               <li> Sometimes the pressure gets so intolerable, that some men or women rush into a relationship, just to
                regret it later - simply because they did not allow themselves time to really assess the future of the
                match. 31-year-old Shikha Patil shares, "I was dating this guy and having fun until my peers started
                forcing me to turn it into something serious. I wasn't fully ready but I succumbed to the pressure. We
                got married within 7 months of knowing each other and got divorced shortly therafter."</li>
                <li>So what is the right approach? Ask yourself if you really want to tie the knot and if you're ready to
                settle down. Be honest with yourself. Take into consideration all the factors and give yourself some
                time to figure things out. Be gentle with yourself and don't feel any kind of pressure. If you're scared
                of getting married or you're feeling too overwhelmed, it's alright. You've got all the time you want to
                decide when and if you wish to get married. Dr Prachi opines, "These pressures just kill the joy of
                relationships. I stopped learning how to enjoy my affairs and started focusing too heavily on who is
                    marriage worthy. Or how soon will the boy propose marriage."</li>
               <li> Once you know how you feel, you will have a better idea bout what you wish to do. You'll be in a good
                space of mind if you already know how your partner feels about getting married. If you don't know how
                they feel, you can always talk about it. Either way, getting married should always be your decision to
                   make and not someone else's.</li></ul>

        <h1 class="h-primary center">Coping Up</h1>
        <div class="box">
            <h1>9 Solo Activities for Managing Loneliness</h1>
            <h2>1:- An Exercise Class:-</h2>
            <p>
                Being physically active prompts the release of brain chemicals such as
                neurotransmitters and endorphins, which can boost mood and ease depression symptoms. Exercise can also
                build
                confidence and help you cope with stress or anxiety. To combat feelings of loneliness, try participating
                in
                a home-based exercise class. Many companies, such as Beachbody, Peloton, and Obé Fitness, offer live or
                on-demand group classes that make you feel like you are part of a fitness community.
            </p>
            <h2>2:- Meditate</h2>
            <p>Even simple meditation techniques can improve a negative mood and reduce stress. A 2019 study published
                in the journal PNAS, for example, found a two-week smartphone-based mindfulness training program reduced
                loneliness and increased feelings of social connection in daily life. Consider taking a basic meditation
                class or follow a beginner's audio or video guide through a site like Head Space.</p>

            <h2>3:- Do Yoga </h2>
            <p>A 2019 study published in the Journal of Psychiatric Practice found that within a month of starting a
                yoga program, participants reported fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety, along with better sleep
                quality. And because yoga is a mind-body practice, it's best done when you can devote your full
                attention to it, making it an excellent solo activity.</p>

            <h2> 4:- Get a Pet</h2>
            <p>
                So many people have adopted pets during the pandemic that many shelters have run short of dogs and cats.
                And
                it’s no wonder. Pets provide companionship, can give owners a sense of purpose and satisfaction, and
                help
                reduce feelings of loneliness. In a study published in the journal Aging and Mental Health, researchers
                analyzed data from 830 primary care patients aged 60 and older. They found pet owners were 36 percent
                less
                likely than non–pet owners to report feelings of loneliness.</p>

            <h2>5:- Garden</h2>
            <p>
                Like cognitive behaviorial therapy, which helps people redirect thinking, engaging your mind in
                something
                else, particularly something creative, like gardening, can be helpful and uplifting. With gardening, the
                added benefit of being in sunshine — weather permitting — can improve outcomes. Research presented at
                the
                2020 Chelsea Flower Show in London suggests that gardening in your front yard, as opposed to your
                backyard,
                may also help lessen feelings of loneliness. Experts say the reason is your front yard is a better
                avenue
                for interacting with neighbors and your community. Bonus: You can still social distance.
            </p>

            <h2>6:- Volunteer</h2>
            <p>
                An analysis of 40 studies conducted by researchers in the United Kingdom and published in 2013 in the
                journal BMC Public Health shows that volunteering even 10 hours a month or less can increase a sense of
                well-being and satisfaction. "Good relationships along with some reliable, productive outlet — such as
                work
                or volunteering — that provides some structure, extra meaning, and a certain amount of reward outside
                the
                social circle can be really helpful," explains Peter Kramer, MD, a clinical professor emeritus of
                psychiatry
                and human behavior at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.
            </p>
            <h2>7:- Read</h2>
            <p>
                A 2011 study published in Psychological Science found that engrossing yourself in the character in a
                book’s
                story can help shift your mood and move your thoughts in a new — and better — direction. For people who
                have
                mild depression, reading a self-help book or other motivational book between therapy sessions can be
                helpful
                — and might even accelerate recovery. A study published in the journal Clinical Psychology &
                Psychotherapy
                in 2010 found that this practice, known as cognitive bibliotherapy, resulted in a dramatic improvement
                in
                depression symptoms.</p>

            <h2>8:- Listen to Music</h2>
            <p>
                Love a good song? Listening to music can help ease depression and loneliness. A 2010 review of studies
                on
                listening to music found that tuning in to your favorite songs can improve depression symptoms. Another
                2020
                study published in the journal Music & Science found participants reported feeling less lonely after
                listening to their personal music, regardless of their mood state.
            </p>
            <h2>9:- Connect</h2>
            <p>
                Communicating with others virtually is easier than ever. Video chat platforms such as Zoom, Google Duo,
                Skype, Facetime, and others allow you to connect with friends and family when you feel lonely or down. A
                study published in 2016 in Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking, in fact, shows that
                isolated
                elderly adults feel less lonely when they use these tools. If you’re not feeling connected to family or
                friends right now, many places — from museums to cooking schools—are offering online programs that allow
                you
                to learn and interact with others.</p>
