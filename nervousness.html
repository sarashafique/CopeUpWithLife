        <p>Nervousness is a common feeling brought on by your body's stress response. <br>This involves series of
            hormonal
            and physiological responses that help prepare you to handle a perceived or imagined threat.<br> Your body
            prepares to fight or flee a threat by boosting adrenaline production.

                Stress is a reaction to a situation where a person feels threatened or anxious. Learning healthy ways to
                cope and getting the right care and support can help reduce stressful feelings and symptoms.
                <br>
                After a traumatic event, people may have strong and lingering reactions. These events may include
                personal
                or environmental disasters, or threats with an assault. The symptoms may be physical or emotional.
                Common
                reactions to a stressful event can include:
            </p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>disbelief, shock, and numbness</li>
                <li>feeling sad, frustrated, and helpless</li>
                <li>difficulty concentrating and making decisions</li>
                <li>headaches, back pains, and stomach problems</li>
                <li>smoking or use of alcohol or drugs</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Feeling emotional and nervous or having trouble sleeping and eating can all be normal reactions to
                stress. Here are some healthy ways you can deal with stress:
            </p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>
                    <h3>
                        Take care of yourself.</h3> Eat healthy, exercise, get plenty of sleep, and give yourself a
                    break if you feel
                    stressed out.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Talk to others.</h3> Share your problems and how you are feeling and coping with a parent,
                    friend, counselor,
                    doctor, or pastor.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3> Avoid drugs and alcohol.</h3> These may seem to help, but they can create additional problems
                    and increase
                    the stress you are already feeling.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Take a break.</h3> If news events are causing your stress, take a break from listening or
                    watching the news.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Recognize when you need more help.</h3> If problems continue or you are thinking about suicide,
                    talk to a
                    psychologist, social worker, or professional counselor.

            <p>For those with an anxiety disorder, it’s important to look into strategies that can help manage or reduce
                anxiety in the long term, like talk therapy or medication. But everyone can benefit from other ways to
                reduce stress and anxiety with lifestyle changes such as eating a well-balanced diet, limiting alcohol
                and caffeine, and taking time for yourself.

                Plus, there are steps you can take the moment when anxiety starts to take hold. Try these 10
                expert-backed suggestions to relax your mind and help you regain control of your thoughts.
            </p>
            <ol class="list">
                <li>
                    <h3> Stay in your time zone.</h3>
                    Anxiety is a future-oriented state of mind. So instead of worrying about what’s going to happen,
                    “reel yourself back to the present,” says Tamar Chansky, Ph.D., a psychologist and author of Freeing
                    Yourself from Anxiety. Ask yourself: What’s happening right now? Am I safe? Is there something I
                    need to do right now? If not, make an “appointment” to check in with yourself later in the day to
                    revisit your worries so those distant scenarios don’t throw you off track, she says.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3> Relabel what’s happening.</h3>
                    Panic attacks can often make you feel like you’re dying or having a heart attack. Remind yourself:
                    “I’m having a panic attack, but it’s harmless, it’s temporary, and there’s nothing I need to do,”
                    Chansky says. Plus, keep in mind it really is the opposite of a sign of impending death -- your body
                    is activating its fight-or-flight response, the system that’s going to keep you alive, she says.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3> Fact-check your thoughts.</h3>
                    People with anxiety often fixate on worst-case scenarios, Chansky says. To combat these worries,
                    think about how realistic they are. Say you’re nervous about a big presentation at work. Rather than
                    think, “I’m going to bomb,” for example, say, “I’m nervous, but I’m prepared. Some things will go
                    well, and some may not,” she suggests. Getting into a pattern of rethinking your fears helps train
                    your brain to come up with a rational way to deal with your anxious thoughts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3> Breathe in and out.</h3>
                    Deep breathing helps you calm down. While you may have heard about specific breathing exercises, you
                    don’t need to worry about counting out a certain number of breaths, Chansky says. Instead just focus
                    on evenly inhaling and exhaling. This will help slow down and re-center your mind, she says.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3> Follow the 3-3-3 rule.</h3>
                    Look around you and name three things you see. Then, name three sounds you hear. Finally, move three
                    parts of your body -- your ankle, fingers, or arm. Whenever you feel your brain going 100 miles per
                    hour, this mental trick can help center your mind, bringing you back to the present moment, Chansky
                    says.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3> Just do something.</h3>
                    Stand up, take a walk, throw away a piece of trash from your desk -- any action that interrupts your
                    train of thought helps you regain a sense of control, Chansky suggests.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3> Stand up straight.</h3>
                    When we are anxious, we protect our upper body -- where our heart and lungs are located -- by
                    hunching over,” Chansky says. For an immediate physical antidote to this natural reaction, pull your
                    shoulders back, stand or sit with your feet apart, and open your chest. This helps your body start
                    to sense that it’s back in control, she says.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3> Stay away from sugar.</h3>
                    It may be tempting to reach for something sweet when you’re stressed, but that chocolate bar can do
                    more harm than good, as research shows that eating too much sugar can worsen anxious feelings.
                    Instead of reaching into the candy bowl, drink a glass of water or eat protein, Chansky says, which
                    will provide a slow energy your body can use to recover.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3> Ask for a second opinion.</h3>
                    Call or text a friend or family member and run through your worries with them, Chansky says. “Saying
                    them aloud to someone else can help you see them clearly for what they are.” It can also help to
                    write your fears on paper.
                </li>
                1<li>
                    <h3> Watch a funny video.</h3>
                    This final tactic may be the easiest one yet: Cue up clips of your favorite comedian or funny TV
                    show. Laughing is a good prescription for an anxious mind, Chansky says. Research shows that
                    laughter has lots of benefits for our mental health and well-being; one study found that humor could
                    help lower anxiety as much as (or even more than) exercise can.

        <h1 class="h-primary center">Sick feeling in stomach</h1>
        <div class="box">
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Although stress is a normal part of life and impossible to avoid, there is good news. You can manage
                    your stress so that it reduces its impact on your stomach. Here are six tips that can help you
                    reduce stress AND the related tummy troubles.
                </li>
                <li>Take short breaks and breathe. When done right this can really help. Every couple of hours, stop
                    what you’re doing and do one minute of slow, quiet deep breathing. You’ll be amazed at the results.
                    Your breathing should be very slow, silent, and through your nose. Push your stomach out when you
                    inhale and let it deflate as you exhale.
                </li>
                <li>Just say “no.” Trying to do everything and please everybody all the time is a surefire recipe for
                    stress. Know your limits and when you’re close to reaching them, don’t accept additional
                    responsibilities.
                </li>
                <li>Exercise or do yoga. Physical activity is a great way to reduce stress, even if it’s only for
                    fifteen minutes a day. When you exercise your body releases chemicals called endorphins which
                    interact with receptors in your brain and trigger a positive feeling in your body.
                </li>
                <li>Instead of stressing over things you can’t control focus on the things you can control, such as how
                    you choose to react to problems. Your reaction is your choice, including how you react to your
                    stomach issues. Accepting stomach problems will reduce your anxiety and curb your symptoms. Worrying
                    about your stomach, only makes your symptoms worse.
                </li>
                <li>Listen to a guided relaxation exercise daily. You’ll not only feel relaxed while doing it, but most
                    people also experience a sense of calm that lasts for hours afterwards.
                </li>
                <li>Seek the help of a therapist who specializes in anxiety. It’s often too difficult to deal with
                    chronic worry and complicated anxiety on your own. A skilled Cognitive Behavioral Therapist will
                    know what to do. You can find a therapist at ADAA.org.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p> It takes effort to reduce stress and its impact on the stomach. These suggestions can work if you
                implement
                them correctly and if you make them a daily priority. However, expecting immediate results and 100%
                absence
                of symptoms will only increase your frustration and symptoms. Acceptance of some degree of stomach
                discomfort is important.

                Finally, take a look at your diet. Certain foods are known to irritate the stomach. Consult a doctor and
                try
                the recommended medical treatments. Many stomach disorders cannot be resolved with stress reduction
                alone.
                You must address the biological,psychological and social aspects when trying to resolve gut related
                problems.</p>
