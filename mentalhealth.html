        <p>Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. <br>It affects how we think,
            feel,
            and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices.

        <div class="box">
            <p> A clear distinction is often made between 'mind' and 'body'. But when considering mental health and
                physical
                health, the two should not be thought of as separate.
                <br>
                Poor physical health can lead to an increased risk of developing mental health problems. Similarly, poor
                mental health can negatively impact on physical health, leading to an increased risk of some conditions.
                <br>
                Since the founding of the NHS in 1948, physical care and mental health care have largely been
                disconnected.
                There is an increasing call on healthcare professionals to consider psychological wellbeing when
                treating
                the physical symptoms of a condition and vice versa.
                <br>There are various ways in which poor mental health has been shown to be detrimental to physical
                health.

                <br>This is because people with mental health conditions are less likely to receive the physical
                healthcare
                they're entitled to. Mental health service users are statistically less likely to receive the routine
                checks
                (like blood pressure, weight and cholesterol) that might detect symptoms of these physical health
                conditions
                earlier. They are also not as likely to be offered help to give up smoking, reduce alcohol consumption
                and
                make positive adjustments to their diet.

                    <h3>Exercise</b></h3>
                    Physical activity in any form is a great way to keep you physically healthy as well as improving
                    your
                    mental wellbeing. Research shows that doing exercise influences the release and uptake of feel-good
                    chemicals called endorphins in the brain.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Diet</h3>Good nutrition is a crucial factor in influencing the way we feel. A healthy balanced
                    diet is one that includes healthy amounts of proteins, essential fats, complex carbohydrates,
                    vitamins, minerals and water.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Smoking</h3>Smoking has a negative impact on both mental and physical health. Many people with
                    mental health problems believe that smoking relieves their symptoms, but these effects are only
                    short-term.

        <div class="box">
            <p>Emotional health is an important part of overall health. People who are emotionally healthy are in
                control of their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. They’re able to cope with life’s challenges. They
                can keep problems in perspective and bounce back from setbacks. They feel good about themselves and have
                good relationships.
                <br>
                Being emotionally healthy doesn’t mean you’re happy all the time. It means you’re aware of your
                emotions. You can deal with them, whether they’re positive or negative. Emotionally healthy people still
                feel stress, anger, and sadness. But they know how to manage their negative feelings. They can tell when
                a problem is more than they can handle on their own. They also know when to seek help from their doctor.
                <br>
                Research shows that emotional health is a skill. There are steps you can take to improve your emotional
                health and be happier.
            </p>
            <ul class="list">
                There are many ways to improve or maintain good emotional health.
                <li>
                    <h3>Be aware of your emotions and reactions.</h3>Notice what in your life makes you sad, frustrated,
                    or angry. Try to address or change those things.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Express your feelings in appropriate ways.</h3>Let people close to you know when something is
                    bothering you. Keeping feelings of sadness or anger inside adds to stress. It can cause problems in
                    your relationships and at work or school.
                </li>
                <li>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Manage stress.</h3> Learn relaxation methods to cope with stress. These could include deep
                    breathing, meditation, and exercise.

                <li>
                    <h3>Strive for balance.</h3>Find a healthy balance between work and play, and between activity and

                    sleep. Don’t abuse drugs or alcohol. Keep your physical health from affecting your emotional health.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Connect with others.</h3> Make a lunch date, join a group, and say hi to strangers. We need
                    positive connections with other people.

        <h1 class="h-primary center">Factors</h1>
        <div class="box">
            <h2 align="center">Stress</h2>
            <p>No one likes to be stressed out – especially when we know it can be linked to
                poor health. Learning how to
                manage your stress can be a small change with a big positive impact on your physical and mental health.

                Stress is a normal part of life. You can feel stress in your body when you have too much to do or when
                you
                haven’t slept well. You can also feel stress when you worry about things like your job, money,
                relationships, or a friend or family member who is struggling with illness or difficult circumstances.
            </p>
            <h2 align="center">Sleep</h2>
            <p>Your physical and emotional health depend so much on how rested you are. Sleep is fundamental to a
                healthy mind and body – getting a good night’s sleep can make a huge difference in your overall health.

                It plays a role in our moods, ability to learn and make memories, the health of our organs, how well our
                immune system works, and other bodily functions like appetite, metabolism, and hormone release.</p>

            <h2 align="center">Exercise</h2>
            <p>Staying active can benefit so many aspects of your health and can even prevent physical and mental health
                symptoms from worsening. It’s important to incorporate physical activity daily to ensure your body and
                your mind are healthy.

                You don’t have to have a gym membership to make exercise a part of your life. Picking physical
                activities that you enjoy and are easy to incorporate into your routine is important.</p>
            <h2 align="center">Nutrition, Diet, and Gut Health</h2>
            <p>The quality of the food you eat can impact your overall physical and mental health. Eating nutritious
                foods can go a long way toward achieving a healthy lifestyle.

                That gut-wrenching feeling in the pit of your stomach is all too real – your gut is sensitive to
                emotions like anger, anxiety, sadness, and joy – and your brain can react to signals from your stomach.
                All the more reason to eat a balanced and nutritious diet – so that your gut and your brain can be
                healthy.

                Diet is linked to the hippocampus, a key area of the brain involved in learning, memory, and mental
                health. People with healthy diets have more hippocampal volume than those with unhealthy diets.</p>
