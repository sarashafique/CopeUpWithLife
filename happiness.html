                Life is a blessing and it is a world which is full of reality. It is natural that every human on the
                earth
                wants to know the reason behind things happening to them. Say for example everyone wants to know about
                the
                reason for his birth in this world, daily activities which are carried out by him, reason for education
                or
                many other activities of the routine. Usually, humans remain worried by thinking about such daily
                happenings
                in their life and sometimes thinking about the things which may not even happen.
                <br>
                Problems are just a part of everyone’s life. The God who created problem will also provide a solution to
                the
                problem. But people keep thinking about the problems they have in life. Every men and women wants things
                to
                happen as they wish and when things take a deviation from their wish, it gives them stress. They keep
                cursing God for making such a mess and complain that things are wrong with them only. It is difficult to
                lead a happy and peaceful life if one keeps blaming and sticking to the problems alone in life. Problems
                may
                appear and vanish but Life is once. Failing to live a happy life once missed is missed .It cannot be
                gained
                back. To lead a happy and healthy life Self Satisfaction plays a key and vital role. Self-satisfaction
                should be achieved in all aspects of life. Achieving self-satisfaction lies within oneself. Balancing
                physical and emotional issues can lead us to achieve self-satisfaction.

                Self-satisfaction is the feeling of being content. It is when people around us are high and keep growing
                stop being jealous and worried. Be happy and contended with what you have.

            </p>
            <h2>Ways to achieve self-satisfaction:-</h2>
            <ul class="list">
                <li><b>Positive Thinking Process:-</b>
                    Though you don’t attain any growth or good things in life don’t envy at the ones who attain growth
                    and
                    popularity.</li>
                <li>
                    <b> Stress free mind:-</b>
                    Do not ever have any sort of negativity in your mind. Negativity is a strong weapon that destroys
                    one’s
                    life. Whenever you feel negative stay focused to achieve your goal and divert yourself to forget the
                    negativity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Begin your day with Happiness:-</b>
                    Happiness is one of the key elements to be self-satisfied. Start your day with full energy and
                    happiness.
                    The energy of your happiness may even cast your worries aside and boom your growth.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b> End your day with Gratitude:-</b>
                    Always be thankful at the end of the day whether it was good or bad. Things change and if it was
                    even a bad
                    day you may have a change and good days later.
                </li>
                <li><b>
                        Live the moment:-</b>
                    Never ever think about past and waste your time. Live each and every moment with full of energy.
                    Thinking
                    about past will not change anything. It changes only our mind and makes us overburdened.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b> Fix your Goals:-</b>
                    There is no necessity that goals should always be very high. Fix your goals according to your life.
                    Try to
                    achieve a small part of your goal at the end of every day. Achieving a nano size improvement also
                    makes us
                    feel much happy.
                </li>
                <li></b>
                    Have Positive people around:-</b>
                    1 true friend is better than 100 fake friends around. It is very important to have good and positive
                    people
                    around. The person who is around us should be a booster of our energy. They should not be the one
                    who ruins
                    our positivity and thoughts.
                </li>
                <li><b>
                        Learn from mistakes:-</b>
                    When you commit a mistake once, all you must do is try to sort a way to clear the mistakes. When you
                    keep
                    repeating the same mistake again and again then you lose self-confidence. Once self-confidence is
                    lost
                    automatically we lose self-satisfaction.
                </li>
                <li><b>
                        Have time for yourself:-</b>
                    Since it is self-satisfaction you must find time for your own self. Take time to think the things
                    you have
                    done, things you are doing, things you will do. Try to find whether things are aligned right. Find
                    out if
                    there is any hindrance in your path. If so try to find the reason behind it and sort it out.
                </li>
                <li><b>
                        Don’t let your self-respect down:-</b>
                    Whether we are respected among others or not, we must try to respect ourselves. Respect oneself in
                    all the
                    ways. i.e respect your thoughts, respect your feelings, respect your opinions.

                <li><b> Stop waiting to be happy.</b>
                    The good news is there are always fresh opportunities to be happy. Imagine life is like Grand
                    Central Station, where happy times arrive around the clock. Chances are the opportunity to be happy
                    has already arrived. Sometimes it’s right in front of you. For whatever reason, you are unable to
                    shift your focus to notice and appreciate it.
                    Regardless of what is going on around you, you can feel happier, be productive, attract success and
                    enjoy yourself during the process. When you shift your focus and the way you think, your perspective
                    changes. When shift happens, your life changes. So get your shift together.

                        Add happiness to your life, right now.</b>
                    Can you see it? You live on a tropical island. You get up when you like and you do what you want.
                    Some guy named Jeeves brings breakfast. From a reclined position on your balcony, all you can see is
                    the ocean and your feet. Ah, the life of the young and retired.

                    We all dream of being happy someday. Until then, we are overworked, overstressed and under-happy.
                    The dream doesn’t seem possible without a lottery win or a call from a wealthy uncle in poor health.
                    But what fun is life if we aren’t happy about it?
                    The good news is, you can add happiness to your life now. Just a few serotonin-producing activities
                    can reduce stress and make the wait for Utopia easier to bear.

                        Make self-care part of your routine.
                    </b>
                    Being able to take a moment for yourself in order to hit the reset button is something we all need
                    to do every once in a while. But here’s the thing: Taking a timeout to give yourself a moment of
                    respite or relaxation or indulgence is only part of the battle. We carve out time for happy hour,
                    but it ends up being less than happy because you’re thinking about the last couple of emails you
                    didn’t get to in order to be there. How can anyone binge watch Netflix stress-free with piles of
                    dirty laundry lurking next to the TV? Can you really go to town on that box of salted caramels
                    knowing you haven’t been to the dentist in 18 months? Or when you still haven’t ordered a wedding
                    gift for your college roommate and it’s been two years since the wedding?
                    One of the surest ways to let that self-care time shine is to make sure you’re not stressing about
                    miscellaneous, small-ball to-do’s while you’re trying to check the eff out. Get yourself sorted so
                    that your “me time” can be as effective as possible.
                </li>
                <li><b>Get in a joyful state of mind.</b>
                    A joyful life is the best existence we can hope to achieve. It’s the kind of life that produces
                    positive vibes and feel-good energy, and encourages us to look to the future with high hopes. Pure
                    joy might seem like a fleeting emotion, but even if you only feel it for a moment in time, you can
                    hold onto it. You can relish in it.
                </li>
                <li><b>
                        Stop worrying.</b>
                    Happiness works much like love, in mysterious ways. However, science and psychology tell us that
                    brain chemistry alters emotion. But in order to activate those chemicals, we have to talk about
                    habits first.
                    There is a formula to happiness, and it lies in changing thought patterns. Your patterns—what you do
                    and think and say every day—determine how happy you are. It’s got nothing to do with what’s around
                    you, but everything to do with how your brain works—that inner voice. Happiness is not within your
                    grasp because it is, quite literally, within you.
                </li>
                <li><b>
                        Appreciate the small things.</b>
                    We all have them; those small moments or things that often go unnoticed or unappreciated because we
                    think they’re either insignificant or we take them for granted because we live in a culture that
                    celebrates big accomplishments. But what if we made it a habit to embrace and celebrate the small
                    things? Real life is happening all around us while we’re waiting for the big thing we hope is going
                    to give us some sort of inner peace, contentment or joy. The truth is that often the things that
                    matter most are the small ones.
                </li>
                <li><b> Surround yourself with positive people.</b>
                    One big mistake people make is not realizing that happiness is an individual choice. But every
                    choice is influenced by the people in our lives. If you change your life influencers for the better,
                    you can dramatically increase your chances for happiness and success.</li>
                <li><b>
                        Laugh more.</b>
                    Breaking news: Laughing makes you feel good. OK, maybe this isn’t so surprising. But try to think
                    about the last time you really laughed—chances are, it may have been some time ago. Preoccupied with
                    all of our grownup responsibilities, we adults just don’t giggle as often as we did when we were
                    kids.
                    We should, though! Laughing has been shown to reduce stress, enhance immunity, improve blood flow
                    and strengthen relationships.

                </li>
                <li><b> Find bliss in a bucket list.</b>
                    Each time I complete one of these checked boxes, there is a moment. Sometimes it only lasts a flash
                    of a second, but on the lucky days it lingers for minutes or hours. It’s a moment, a fleeting
                    moment, where I can honestly say that I’ve found bliss. It’s every part of you, from your fingers to
                    your toes nearly bursting with light and full with purpose. It’s the amazement, pride, triumph and
                    an overwhelming sensation of the purest self-love. It’s your entire perspective changing after
                    seeing the world from a different lens. It’s the feeling of feeling completely in the moment. It’s
                    being alive.

                    safeguard the one thing that can make a difference in the quality of our lives as we get older: our
